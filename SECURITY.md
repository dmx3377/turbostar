# Security Policy

Security is a top priority in all my projects. Despite careful design and testing, vulnerabilities can occasionally occur. This policy outlines how to responsibly report security issues and what to expect in terms of response.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly. Depending on the urgency, there are several ways to contact me.

| Type                    | Description                                                                                                          | Action Required                              | Estimated Response Time |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Critical / Urgent**   | Vulnerabilities that could lead to immediate exploitation, data loss, or service disruption (e.g., zero-day attacks) | Contact me **immediately via email**         | ≤ 24 hours              |
| **Moderate**            | Issues that may have impact but are not actively being exploited                                                     | Contact me via **email** or **contact form** | 48–72 hours             |
| **Low / Informational** | Minor bugs, potential improvements, or security concerns with low impact                                             | Submit via **contact form**                  | 5-7 days                  |

### Best Practices

While reporting vulnerabilities, please:

* Do **not** publicly disclose the issue before it has been resolved
* Avoid accessing or modifying data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability
* Be respectful and professional

All valid reports are taken seriously, and I aim to acknowledge and resolve them as quickly as possible.
